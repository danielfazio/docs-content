# About [about]

Elasticsearch Curator helps you curate, or manage, your Elasticsearch indices and snapshots by:

1. Obtaining the full list of indices (or snapshots) from the cluster, as the *actionable list*
2. Iterate through a list of user-defined [filters](asciidocalypse://docs/curator/docs/reference/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-client-curator/filters.md) to progressively remove indices (or snapshots) from this *actionable list* as needed.
3. Perform various [actions](asciidocalypse://docs/curator/docs/reference/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-client-curator/actions.md) on the items which remain in the *actionable list.*
