# Query rules GUI

Query rules GUI is a user interface that helps you create, edit, and delete query rules. The interface is implemented on top of the existing Query Rules API and provides non-technical users with an intuitive, streamlined interface to manage query rules.


Query rules help customize search results, giving you more control over how results are returned based on the contextual information in the query. For more information on query rules, refer to our [Query Rules blog](https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/blog/elasticsearch-query-rules-generally-available).

You can do the following using the GUI without the need of any API calls:

* For a new deployment setup, create new rules
* For an existing deployment setup, edit and delete rules



If you'd still prefer to use the Query Rules API, refer to [Query Rules API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/group/endpoint-query_rules).
For examples how to search using query rules, refer [Search using Query Rules API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/elasticsearch/rest-apis/searching-with-query-rules).

## Security privileges

If you want to get full access to the Query Rules GUI, you must have the following privileges:

* Appropriate roles to access Kibana. For more information, refer to [Built-in roles](https://www.elastic.co/docs/deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/built-in-roles) or  [Kibana privileges](https://www.elastic.co/docs/deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/kibana-privileges)
* A custom role with `manage_search_query_rules` cluster privilege
* `ALL` option for `Query Rules` role privileges in the respective Kibana space

## GUI vs. API: What's the difference?

All the functionality in the GUI works the same as in API calls. The only difference is that the Query Rules GUI will create the pinning action by `docs` instead of the `ids` for the new rulesets. However, you'll be able to edit or delete existing rulesets which use pinning by `ids`. For more information on Rule actions, refer [Rule actions](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/elasticsearch/rest-apis/searching-with-query-rules#query-rule-actions).

## Using the GUI

Go to your hosted deployment and select **Query Rules** from the left navigation menu. If you're not able to see the option, contact the administrator to review the role assigned to you. The following screenshot shows the GUI for a new cloud hosted setup.
