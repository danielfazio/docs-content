# Cases [observability-cases]

Collect and share information about observability issues by creating a case. Cases allow you to track key investigation details, add assignees and tags to your cases, set their severity and status, and add alerts, comments, and visualizations. You can also send cases to third-party systems by [configuring external connectors](/solutions/observability/incident-management/configure-case-settings.md).

::::{note}
* From {{observability}} in the {{stack}}, you cannot access cases created in {{elastic-sec}} or Stack Management.  
* With the appropriate index access, you can [build visualizations](../../../explore-analyze/alerts-cases/cases/visualize-case-data.md) of {{observability}}, Stack Management, and {{elastic-sec}} case data to improve your visibility into case patterns and trends within your space.
