# Upload custom plugins and bundles


If you're using {{ece}} or {{ech}}, then you must [upload this file as a custom bundle](/deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/upload-custom-plugins-bundles.md) before it can be referenced. If you're using {{eck}}, then install the file as a [custom configuration file](/deploy-manage/deploy/cloud-on-k8s/custom-configuration-files-plugins.md#use-a-volume-and-volume-mount-together-with-a-configmap-or-secret). If you're using a self-managed cluster, then the file must be present on each node.
